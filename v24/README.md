## Commissioning

* Hotend thermistor wires don't like staying in their crimps on the toolhead board. Maybe the SB board with the Molex connector will be better?
* Add jumpers to M3-2 to disable to dual-Z and to enable `STEPPER_BUZZ stepper=stepper_z` to actually work.
* Move the X and Y endstop from (-) to (+)
* Hall Effect sensor board - Y works, X LED stays lit and goes off when triggered - seems inverted logic. Will swap out board and retest once the cables are moved.
* Bed temp thermistor wires might have broken off - not getting any readings and MCU shutdown error. Disabled config.
* Homing X caused the gantry to move down - need to verify what this is - very confusing - used the kill switch on the LCD (checked before issuing the homing command). 

### PID Calibrate

Set fan to 40% and calibrate the heater for the hot end.

```gcode
M106 S102
PID_CALIBRATE heater=extruder TARGET=240
SAVE_CONFIG
```
Extruder settings:
```shell
pid_Kp=24.058 pid_Ki=1.471 pid_Kd=98.339
```

### raspberry pi

* enable SPI
* enable Serial 

Edit `/boot/config.txt` and disable the BT stack to run the GPIO between the spider and the pi.
See the [rpi config](config.txt) for details - just replace the file and reboot.
 
#### change locale

Set en_GB.UTF-8 in localisation `sudo raspi-config` and then update the locale defaults file too.

```shell
cat /etc/defaults/locale
#  File generated by update-locale
LANG=en_GB.UTF-8
LANGUAGE=en_GB.UTF-8
LC_ALL=en_GB.UTF-8
```

#### aliases

Copy the .bash_aliases

#### compile and update klipper

Initial setup. Configure the klipper.config file with the correct parameters.

```shell
mkdir ~/bin
cd ~/bin
ln -sf ~/klipper_config/update-mcu
```

Updating the firmware

```shell
update-mcu
```

Upload the FIRMWARE.BIN to an SDCARD and insert into the board. Press the Reset button once, maybe twice. Check the status lights - fast blinking, then slow blinking and then off.

Remove the SDCARD and confirm the filename has changed to OLD.BIN

Do a FIRMWARE_RESTART in the browser and the board should now be recognised and the thermistors should be active.
