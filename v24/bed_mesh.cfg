[bed_mesh]
##  Start and end point of mesh
mesh_min: 40,20
mesh_max: 260,270
speed: 200
##   The height (in mm) that the head should be commanded to move to
##   just prior to starting a probe operation. The default is 5.
horizontal_move_z: 3 ; MagProbe Klicky
#horizontal_move_z: 4 ; Vinda or Omron
probe_count: 9,9
##   The interpolation algorithm to use. May be either "lagrange"
##   or "bicubic". This option will not affect 3x3 grids, which
##   are forced to use lagrange sampling.  Default is lagrange.
algorithm: bicubic
##[(9x9)-1] / 2 = 40
##[(7x7)-1] / 2 = 24
##[(5x5)-1] / 2 = 12
# relative_reference_index: 12
##   The gcode z position in which to start phasing out z-adjustment
##   when fade is enabled.  Default is 1.0.
#fade_start: 1
##   The gcode z position in which phasing out completes.  When set
##   to a value below fade_start, fade is disabled. It should be
##   noted that fade may add unwanted scaling along the z-axis of a
##   print.  If a user wishes to enable fade, a value of 10.0 is
##   recommended. Default is 0.0, which disables fade.
#fade_end: 10
##   The z position in which fade should converge. When this value is set
##   to a non-zero value it must be within the range of z-values in the mesh.
##   Users that wish to converge to the z homing position should set this to 0.
##   Default is the average z value of the mesh.
#fade_target: 0
##   The distance (in mm) along a move to check for split_delta_z.
##   This is also the minimum length that a move can be split. Default
##   is 5.0.
move_check_distance: 3
##   The amount of Z difference (in mm) along a move that will
##   trigger a split. Default is .025.
split_delta_z: 0.01
##   A comma separated pair of integers (X,Y) defining the number of
##   points per segment to interpolate in the mesh along each axis. A
##   "segment" can be defined as the space between each probed
##   point. The user may enter a single value which will be applied
##   to both axes.  Default is 2,2.
mesh_pps: 5,5
##   When using the bicubic algorithm the tension parameter above
##   may be applied to change the amount of slope interpolated.
##   Larger numbers will increase the amount of slope, which
##   results in more curvature in the mesh. Default is .2.
bicubic_tension: 0.1
zero_reference_position: 150, 150
